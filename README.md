SmartDeviceLink iOS Proxy

We're still working on creating documentation for each of these individual repositories, but in the meantime, you can find more information about SmartDeviceLink [on the SDL Core README](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core/blob/master/README.md) and [on Genivi](http://projects.genivi.org/smartdevicelink/about).

To get started with testing, make sure that you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (`brew update` `brew install carthage`), then run `carthage bootstrap` in the root directory of the repository on your local system. You will then have to drag in `Quick.framework` and `Nimble.framework` to the "Link Binaries with Libraries" build phase. For more information, see the [Carthage Github page](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
